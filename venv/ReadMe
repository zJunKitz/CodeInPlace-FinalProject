Code In Place Final Project
Web Scraping A Self Help Books Recommending Website

For the final project of Code In Place, I decided to make a web scraper by using Python.
I find the idea interesting because one, it definitely sounded awesome and badass, two,
it might be a pratical skill worth learning as mentioned by numerous posts. I chosed Python
simply because I am currently more familiar with it and the Code In Place focuses on Python.

Milestones:
1. Scraping the names and the prices of the books
2. Save the final data into a CSV file
3. (Optional) Make a arranging system to rearrange the books ascendingly according to their price

Challenges:
1. Not knowing how to scrape multiple pages in the same website (Solved)
2. Amazon's script detecter is robust and apparently they prefer me to use APIs rather than scripts (Failed)
